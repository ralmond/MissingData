## Evidence Mix

Case Studies (1/2)

Final Project or Paper (1/2)

## Case Studies (1/2)

-   Serves dual purpose:
    -   Forces you to verbalize your ideas about statistics, this promotes readiness-to-learn
    -   Provides me with formative feedback
-   Will be done on RStudio.cloud platform
-   NOT graded on correctness

## Final project (1/2)

-   Find a data set and a research question
    -   5---10 variables
    -   200+ observations
    -   Research question answerable with generalized linear model.

Option 1:\
\* Complete data (no missing observations) \* Create a data set with missing observations by strategically removing observations \* Focus on evaluationing bias and std error of procedures.

Option 2: \* Real data with really missing observations. \* Focus on answering research questions.

Students will present bits and pieces of the project in class as we cover various techniques.

-   Midterm Project Goal: Look at simple missing data approaches
    -   Complete Case analysis (listwise & pairwise deletion)
    -   Mean imputation
    -   Hot deck imputation
-   Final Project Goal: Look at more complex missing data procedures
    -   Single Imputation
    -   EM Algorithm
    -   Multiple Imputation
    -   MCMC

## Collaboration

-   Case Studies
    -   Case Studies are done in class, but you may get others to assist you with prep.
    -   If you would like to work on an assignment in a team, let me know when the assignment is made.
-   Projects
    -   Collaboration is possible but must be approved in advance
    -   Each team member provides a unique piece

## Collaboration (2)

-   Plagiarism is a serious problem
    -   People have LOST THEIR DEGREES
    -   First time violations will be reported
    -   See FSU policies and resources

## FSU Resources

-   Don't use forums, FSU emails &cfor personal purposes
    -   All FSU emails are public record
-   *Don't use FSU Resources to download copyrighted material not related to your class work or research!*
    -   Beware of leaving Bit Torrent clients on while connected to FSU network
-   Use or the LRC now requires a card swipe

Post (anonymously) on feedback forum in Blackboard

Let me know if you have problems reading material

## Turning the BattleshipCrusier

üëç (Thumbs up) I get it already, you can skip ahead

üëé (Thumbs down) I'm confused, give me more detail

üñêÔ∏è (Hand up) Stop, I have a question (or issue)

This is a small class, so I intend to keep things informal. Feel free to unmute and speak in Zoom.

## What to do if you are lost

-   Confusion is a part of learning

    -   But it should be temporary

-   Ask questions in class!

-   Come visit during office hours, or make an appointment

-   Be specific about what is confusing you

# Washington I-253

What is wrong with this analysis?

## Washington I-253

Washington state allows laws to be enacted by voter petition and referendum (initiatives)

In 1990 I-253 was on the ballot, which would have placed restrictions on a women's right to have an abortion (Yes = conservative position)

About 1,350,000 people voted in that election, about 150,000 by absentee ballot (mainly from King County (Seattle) a more liberal area of the state)

Absentee ballots must be postmarked by election day, so counting is not complete for several weeks after election

## The next day

With 1,200,000 votes counted, Yes was leading 50.25%

Margin of about 6,000 votes, less than absentee ballots

Pundits were predicting that this would turn around when absentee ballots were counted

Let's do hypothesis test

## Hypothesis Test

```{R setup}
n <- 1200000
p0 <- .5
Xbar <- .5025
seXbar <- sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n)
seXbar
z <- (Xbar - p0)/seXbar
z
1-pnorm(z)
```

## Two weeks later

After absentee ballots counted (total votes 1,350,000) Initiative failed Yes: 49.75%, No: 50.25%

Hypothesis test was wrong, pundits were right

What happened?

## Two-sample test assumptions

0.  Data are a representative sample of their respective populations

Conditioned on group membership, observations are independent

The data come from an (approximately) normal population (central limit theorem)

The variances of the two populations are equal

## Missing data is a violation of assumption 0

Complete cases are not representative of the whole data set (even though the sample is a considerable fraction of the size)

Data are not *missing at random* : "No" voters are more likely to have used absentee ballots (i.e., be missing).

## Missing and Latent Variables

-   *Missing completely at random (MCAR) --* whether or not $Y_i$ is missing is independent of both $Y_i$ and any observed covariate $X_i$
    -   Casewise deletion provides an unbiased estimate only in this case!
-   *Missing at Random (MAR)* -- whether or not $Y_i$ is missing is independent of $Y_i$ given observed covariates $X_i$
    -   EM algorithm & MCMC work here
    -   Latent variables are a special case
-   *Non-ignorable* *missingness* *--* Not MAR
-   *Censoring --* Data values above a certain value are *censored* (not missing, as we often have a minimum/maximum value). *Not covered in this course, this is the realm of survival analysis*

## Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)

Illness on day of testing

*Edit Me*

## Structurally Missing (MCAR)

-   Latent Variables
-   Treatment Effects
    -   Treatment effect observed only for observation in treatment group
    -   Control (baseline) effect observed only for observations in control group
    -   Stable Unit Value Treatment Assumption (SUVTA) -- Effect of treatment on control units would be the same (within random error) as effect on treated units (Rubin & Holland)
-   Spiral (Matrix Sampling) Forms
    -   NAEP booklets

## Testing MCAR assumption

-   Assumes we have some demographic variables that are complete (e.g., gender, age, GPA)
-   Use missingness indicator as the treatment variable
-   Test to see if the two groups are the same
    -   $t$-test
    -   $\chi^2$-test

## Missing At Random (MAR)

$Y$ is our target variable

$R$ is missingness indicator for target variable

X is a collection of background (complete) variables

Key is to find a set of $X$ such that $Y$ is conditionally independent of $R$ given $X$

## I-253 Vote by County

```{R county}
I253 <- tribble(
  ~County,       ~Pop, ~PerAbsent, ~Yes,
  "King",     1900000,          2,   48,
  "Pierce",    700000,          1,   49.5,
  "Snohomish", 600000,          1,   50,
  "Spokane",   400000,         .5,  52
)
I253

```

## Pundits' Secret

They are making predictions county by county

They imputed the county average for the in-person vote for the missing votes

Their estimate was hence much better

MCAR was not good, but MAR (conditioned on county) was much better

Conditional mean imputation

## Missing Data codes

-   R uses `NA`
-   For portability, often need a number
    -   Choose a value that is unlikely to occur naturally, e.g., -9, or -999
    -   Then if you forget to code the missing data, you will get unreasonable results
-   Sometimes multiple missing codes
    -   7 -- Skipped item
    -   8 -- Multiple Answer
    -   9 -- Not reached

## MCAR, MAR or Non-ignorable (Ex 9.2)

A survey of high school seniors asks the school administrator to provide grade point average and college entrance exam scores. College entrance exam scores are missing for students who have not taken the test.

Same survey except now survey additionally asks whether or not student has declared an intent to apply for college.

To reduce the burden on the students filling out the survey, the background questions are divided into several sections, and each student is assigned only some of the sections using a spiral pattern. Responses on the unassigned section are missing.

Some students when asked their race decline to answer.

## Part 1

1.  John did not answer Task j because it was not on the test form he was administered.

2.Diwakardid not answer Task j because there are linked harder and easier test forms, intended for fourth and sixth grade students; Task j is an easy item that only appears on the fourth grade form; andDiwakaris in sixth grade, so he was administered the hard form.

3.  Rodrigo took an adaptive test. He did well, the items he was administered tended to be harder as he went along, and Task j was not selected to administer because his responses suggested it was too easy to provide much information about his proficiency.

## Part 2

4.  Task j was near the end of the test, and Ting did not answer it because she ran out of time.

5.  Shahrukh looked at Task j and decided not to answer it because she thought she would probably not do well on it.

6.  Howard was instructed to examine four items and choose two of them to answer. Task j was one of the four, and not one that Howard chose.
